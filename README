git init techtalk extra goodies

The HTML file (slides-git-init-final.html) contains the entire slide deck. All you need to do is open it with a browser and reveal.js should take care of everything (note that there is left/right movement as well as up/down).

The slides use reveal.js. They were created and hosted on slides.com and can be found at:

I have also included my own .gitconfig and .gitignore_global. Note that these should both go in your home directory and you will need to prepend the '.'. I removed this so they are not hidden by default on most systems. Also, be sure to update your name and email!

The .gitignore_global that I have included also ignores a couple of extra things like vim's .swp files and some of Sublime Text's files.

Don't forget that you can find the Git Pro book completely free and available to read or download straight from the git official site below. I cannot recommend it enough. Did I mention it's FREE?
